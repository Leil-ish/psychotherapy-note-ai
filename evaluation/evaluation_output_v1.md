## Evaluation of Generated Note (v1)

This evaluation assesses the clinical note generated by the initial prompt (`prompt_v1.txt`) against the predefined criteria.

### 1. Clinical Accuracy

* **Reflects Transcript Details:** **Largely Met.** The Subjective summary, Assessment themes, and Risk Assessment components generally reflect the core topics and details discussed in the provided transcript (e.g., client's ambivalence, grief, marital concerns, body image issues).
* **Hallucinations/Unsupported Interpretations:** **Partially Failed.**
    * **Visual Hallucinations:** The note includes specific visual details (**"appeared well-groomed," "maintained appropriate eye contact," "occasional nervous smiles"**) in the Objective and MSE sections that **cannot be derived** from the audio transcript provided. This represents factual hallucination.
    * **Interpretations:** The Assessment section includes potential diagnostic considerations ("Adjustment Disorder," "Complicated Grief"). While appropriately qualified ("potential," "further assessment needed"), these are interpretations not explicitly stated in the transcript. Other assessment points seem reasonably inferred from the subjective/objective data presented *in the note*.
* **Tone & Detail:** **Met.** The overall tone is professional, objective, and nonjudgmental, consistent with clinical documentation. The level of detail in summarizing the client's reported experiences (Subjective) and the risk factors seems appropriate.

### 2. Completeness

* **Sections Present:** **Met.** All requested primary sections (SOAP, MSE, Risk Assessment) and their specified sub-sections are present in the generated output.
* **Appropriately Addressed:** **Met.** Each section contains information relevant to its purpose, drawing on the transcript content. The note correctly identifies and states when information for specific MSE domains (e.g., Perception, Cognition) was not available in the transcript.

### 3. Clinical Relevance/Salience

* **Captures Significant Information:** **Met.** The note effectively captures the clinically significant themes of the session (identity crisis post-illness, grief, marital impact, body image, decision-making conflict) rather than focusing excessively on conversational filler.
* **Highlights Safety Details:** **Met.** The dedicated Risk Assessment section clearly outlines the status of SI/HI/Self-Harm, lists relevant risk and protective factors derived from the dialogue, and provides an overall risk level. This makes safety-related information easily accessible to a reviewer.

### Evaluation Summary (v1)

The initial prompt generated a structurally complete and largely relevant clinical note with an appropriate professional tone. The primary failure point lies in **Clinical Accuracy**, specifically the **hallucination of visual details** not derivable from the audio transcript. While interpretations in the Assessment section were present, they were somewhat qualified. The note successfully captured salient clinical themes and presented safety information clearly.

**Key Area for Improvement:** The most critical refinement needed for the prompt (v2) is to add stronger constraints to prevent the generation of unsupported visual observations and ensure stricter adherence to only the information present in the provided transcript text.
