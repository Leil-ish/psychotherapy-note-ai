## Evaluation of Generated Note (v2)

This evaluation assesses the clinical note generated by the refined prompt (`prompt_v2.txt`) against the predefined criteria.

### 1. Clinical Accuracy

* **Reflects Transcript Details:** **Met.** Similar to v1, the note accurately captures the key subjective themes, assessment points, and risk/protective factors discussed in the transcript.
* **Hallucinations/Unsupported Interpretations:** **Significantly Improved / Largely Met.**
    * **Visual Hallucinations:** The prompt refinements were **successful**. The note **correctly omits** descriptions of grooming and eye contact. For Appearance, it accurately states "Visuals not available from transcript." For Behavior/MSE Behavior, it appropriately notes that specific psychomotor activity wasn't described *except* for the "nervous smile," which *was explicitly mentioned by the therapist in the transcript*, demonstrating accurate adherence to the refined constraints.
    * **Interpretations:** The Assessment section remains appropriately interpretive for a clinical summary, still qualifying diagnostic considerations. The Objective section now focuses on affect, speech, and engagement derived from dialogue, which is appropriate for transcript-based analysis.
* **Tone & Detail:** **Met.** The tone remains professional, objective, and nonjudgmental. The level of detail continues to be appropriate.

### 2. Completeness

* **Sections Present:** **Met.** All requested sections (SOAP, MSE, Risk Assessment) and sub-sections are present.
* **Appropriately Addressed:** **Met.** Each section contains relevant information derived from the transcript. The handling of missing information (e.g., "Visuals not available...", "Not indicated...") is consistent and follows the refined prompt instructions.

### 3. Clinical Relevance/Salience

* **Captures Significant Information:** **Met.** The note continues to effectively summarize the core clinical themes and significant moments of the session.
* **Highlights Safety Details:** **Met.** The Risk Assessment section remains clear, accessible, and accurately reflects the safety-related information (or lack thereof) discussed in the transcript. V2 specifically notes the therapist did *not* make explicit safety recommendations but did suggest a medical referral, which is accurate to the transcript.

## Comparative Analysis: v1 vs. v2

* **Accuracy (Visual Hallucinations):** This is the most significant area of improvement. **V2 successfully eliminated the hallucinated visual details** (grooming, eye contact, unsupported smiles) that were present in v1. It correctly identified when visual information was unavailable and accurately reported the *one* non-verbal behavior (nervous smile) that *was* explicitly mentioned in the transcript text. This directly demonstrates the effectiveness of the targeted prompt refinement (adding the constraint about visual details).
* **Adherence to Constraints:** V2 demonstrates much stricter adherence to the constraint of using *only* information present in the transcript, particularly regarding objective observations.
* **Completeness & Relevance:** Both versions performed well in terms of including all required sections and capturing clinically relevant information.
* **Tone & Structure:** Both versions maintained a professional tone and followed the requested structure effectively.
* **Content:** While phrasing differs slightly, the core summaries in the Subjective, Assessment, Plan, and Risk sections cover similar ground in both versions, indicating consistency in extracting the main themes.

## Conclusion on Refinement

The iterative process was successful. Refining the prompt by adding explicit constraints against hallucinating visual details and clarifying instructions for objective/MSE observations directly addressed the primary accuracy issue identified in v1. **Output v2 is a significantly more accurate and trustworthy representation of the information available solely from the provided transcript.** This highlights the importance of precise constraints and iterative testing in prompt engineering for clinical applications.
