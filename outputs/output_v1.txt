**1. SOAP Note**

* **Subjective:**  The client, Annabeth, presented with significant ambivalence regarding her return to professional bowling.  
She reported feelings of guilt stemming from her family's belief that her touring contributed to her recent stage four breast cancer 
diagnosis.  She expressed fear of the unknown should she choose not to return to bowling, stating, "I don't know who that person is."  
Annabeth also revealed that she had avoided breast self-exams and regular doctor visits, attributing this avoidance to her mother's 
death from breast cancer at age 47.  She admitted to lying to her doctor about performing self-exams.  She voiced concerns about the 
potential impact on her marriage if she ceased touring, highlighting her husband's accustomed role as primary caregiver while she is 
away. She acknowledged her physical changes following mastectomy, radiation, and implants as a source of anxiety concerning her 
husband's perception of her body. Annabeth described feeling overwhelmed by the lack of control and extended period of reflection she 
now experiences, contrasting it with her previous highly structured and goal-oriented life as a professional athlete.  She identified 
a desire to understand her own needs and values independent of her family responsibilities.  She ultimately expressed a need for time 
to process her feelings and consider her options before communicating with her family.

* **Objective:**  Annabeth appeared well-groomed and maintained appropriate eye contact throughout the session.  Her affect 
fluctuated between anxious and reflective, accompanied by occasional nervous smiles.  Her speech was coherent and fluent. She 
exhibited insight into her avoidance behaviors and the need for self-reflection. The client actively participated in the therapeutic 
process, providing detailed responses to the therapist's questions.  The client suggested journaling as a method of self-reflection.

* **Assessment:** Annabeth presents with significant emotional distress related to the decision of whether or not to return to 
professional bowling.  Her uncertainty is compounded by unresolved grief related to her mother's death, potentially manifesting 
as avoidance behaviors.  The impact of her illness and its subsequent treatment on her body image and marital dynamic further 
contributes to her distress. Her goal-oriented personality, previously adaptive in her athletic career, now presents a challenge 
as she navigates a life transition without a clear roadmap.  While not explicitly stated, potential diagnostic considerations based 
on this session include Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood and potentially unresolved Complicated Grief. 
Further assessment is needed.

* **Plan:**  Annabeth will engage in journaling to explore her values and desires independently of her family roles.  Future 
sessions will focus on processing her grief, addressing her concerns about her family's reactions, and facilitating open communication 
with her husband and children.  Exploration of her identity separate from her role as a professional bowler will continue. The 
potential for family therapy will be explored in subsequent sessions.
