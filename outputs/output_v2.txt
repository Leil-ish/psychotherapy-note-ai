**1. SOAP Note**

* **Subjective:** Annabeth presented with significant ambivalence regarding her return to professional bowling. She expressed 
feelings of guilt, stemming from her family's perception that her touring contributed to her illness (stage four breast cancer, 
requiring chemo, radiation, mastectomy, and implants).  She also voiced fear of the unknown, questioning her identity and purpose 
outside of her bowling career.  She revealed a history of avoiding self-breast exams and regular doctor visits, potentially linked 
to unresolved grief surrounding her mother's death from breast cancer at age 47.  She expressed concern about the impact of a career 
change on her marriage, fearing her husband's reliance on her absence during tours and questioning whether he would adjust to her 
constant presence.  She acknowledged the significant physical changes resulting from her cancer treatment and the potential effect 
this has on her relationship.  Annabeth demonstrated a strong goal-oriented personality, potentially influenced by her father, but 
expressed a desire to explore her personal wants and needs beyond her professional goals. She reported that the prospect of stopping 
and reflecting on the past felt overwhelming, triggering intense emotions.  She ultimately expressed a desire to have honest 
conversations with her family but felt uncertain about how to proceed, suggesting keeping a journal as a first step.

* **Objective:**  Annabeth's affect ranged from anxious to apprehensive throughout the session, shifting to a more hopeful tone 
toward the end as she considered journaling.  Her speech was clear and coherent, though she occasionally paused for reflection. 
She used emotional language to describe her feelings, acknowledging the "raw" nature of her questions and concerns. The therapist 
noted the client's honest self-reflection and the bravery in her willingness to examine the complexities of her situation. The client 
expressed a desire for guidance in balancing her professional and personal life, indicating a potential challenge in transitioning 
to a new life stage.  The client spontaneously generated the idea of journaling as a coping mechanism and homework assignment.

* **Assessment:** Annabeth presents with complex emotional challenges related to her career, marriage, and unresolved grief.  Her 
symptoms are potentially consistent with adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, although further assessment is 
needed to rule out other diagnoses. Her avoidance of preventative health measures may warrant referral to a medical professional. 
Her thoughtful self-reflection and engagement in therapy suggest a good prognosis with continued treatment.  Her identification of 
her own need for journaling demonstrates positive self-awareness and a willingness to work towards solutions.

* **Plan:** Continue individual therapy focusing on processing unresolved grief, exploring her identity beyond bowling, and 
facilitating open communication with her family.  Exploring potential marital counseling is recommended to address Annabeth’s 
concerns about her relationship.  Referral to a medical doctor for preventative health recommendations is warranted.  Annabeth 
will begin journaling as a self-soothing and self-reflective exercise.   Future sessions will address the identified goal of honest 
communication with her husband and children, potentially through collaborative planning of a family meeting.  The plan also involves 
exploration of potential personal interests and passions to identify goals outside of professional bowling.
